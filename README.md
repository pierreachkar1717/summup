# Summup

Summup is a Python package for summarizing text from different sources, including videos, text, and PDFs. It uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and langauge models (such as gpt 3.5) to extract the most important information from the input text and generate a concise summary. 

**Note:** To use the gpt 3.5 model, you will need to add your API key to a .env file in the root directory of the project.
